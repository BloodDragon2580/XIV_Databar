# XIV_Databar
#### !! ATTENTION !!
When downloading from Github, you'll have to **rename the folder XIV_Databar-master in the .zip to XIV_Databar** or WoW won't be able to detect the AddOn.

Once I've finished my to-do list I intend to upload this AddOn to Curseforge so the poor Twitch App users can auto-download again.

#### TO-DO LIST:
- Bugfixes as they come up
- [Currency] Move currency module to the left of the talent module
- [Currency] Add currencies to table, display currencies of the table in currency tooltip
- [Currency] Track 0 - 1 currencies in the bar, tracking 0 just displays the icon or icon + "CURRENCIES"
- [Currency] Add the option use XP bar at max level for tracked reputations instead
- [Tradeskill] Complete code to display up to 3 professions (first, second, cooking)
- [Travel] Add teleport options and fix various bugs and inconsistencies of the travel module
